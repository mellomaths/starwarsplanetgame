# Star Wars Planet Game

It's a React Single Page Application that shows data like climate and terrain from a random planet from the Star Wars Universe. Deployed on Heroku's server, see the app running in the web by clicking [here](https://starwarsplanetgame.herokuapp.com/). For CSS, the app uses the [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) responsive front-end framework.

You should join some friends and make them guess what planet it's shown based on the information you have.

This application consumes data from the [SWAPI](https://swapi.co/).
